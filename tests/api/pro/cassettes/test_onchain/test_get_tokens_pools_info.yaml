        is WETH (Wrapped ETH)?\\r\\nWETH is the tokenized/packaged form of ETH that
        you use to pay for items when you interact with Ethereum dApps. WETH follows
        the ERC-20 token standards, enabling it to achieve interoperability with other
        ERC-20 tokens.\_\\r\\n\\r\\nThis offers more utility to holders as they can
        use it across networks and dApps. You can stake, yield farm, lend, and provide
        liquidity to various liquidity pools with WETH.\_\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, unlike
        ETH, which doesn\u2019t conform to its own ERC-20 standard and thus has lower
        interoperability as it can\u2019t be used on other chains besides Ethereum,
        WETH can be used on cheaper and high throughput alternatives like Binance,
        Polygon, Solana, and Cardano.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe price of WETH will always be
        the same as ETH because it maintains a 1:1 wrapping ratio.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow
        to Wrap ETH?\\r\\nCustodians wrap and unwrap ETH. To wrap ETH, you send ETH
        to a custodian. This can be a multi-sig wallet, a Decentralized Autonomous
        Organization (DAO), or a smart contract. After connecting your web3 wallet
        to a DeFi exchange, you enter the amount of ETH you wish to wrap and click
        the swap function. Once the transaction is confirmed, you will receive WETH
        tokens equivalent to the ETH that you\u2019ve swapped.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a centralized
        exchange, the exchange burns the deposited ETH and mints a wrapped form for
        you. And when you want to unwrap it, the exchange will burn the wrapped version
        and mint the ETH on your behalf.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\u2019s Next for WETH?\\r\\nAccording
        to the developers, hopefully there will be no future for WETH. According to
        the website, steps are being taken to update ETH to make it compliant with
        its own ERC-20 standards.\_\",\"gt_score\":100.0,\"discord_url\":null,\"telegram_handle\":null,\"twitter_handle\":null}},{\"id\":\"eth_0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7\",\"type\":\"token\",\"attributes\":{\"address\":\"0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7\",\"name\":\"Tether

        (USDT) is a cryptocurrency with a value meant to mirror the value of the U.S.
        dollar. The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like
        digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute
        are called \u201Cstable coins.\u201D Tether is the most popular stable coin
        and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According
        to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or \u201Ctether\u201D
        the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar,
        the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other
        cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] \u201C100% backed by
        USD\u201D (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers
        some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity
        to exchanges who can\u2019t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to
        the sometimes controversial but leading exchange \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitfinex\\\"\\u003eBitfinex\\u003c/a\\u003e).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe
        digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed
        by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of
        its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus
        van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been
        accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as
        tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether
        to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using
        this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out
        of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky
        relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.\\r\\n\\r\\nUSDT
        is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex\\\"\\u003ePoloniex\\u003c/a\\u003e
        or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
        It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet.
        Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may
        charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to
        Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin
        can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously
        or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between
        USD to and from your bank account.\",\"gt_score\":100.0,\"discord_url\":null,\"telegram_handle\":null,\"twitter_handle\":\"Tether_to\"}}]}"
